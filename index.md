# Workshop description 


Our senses are the gateways to our memories and emotions. However, they are under-represented in language technology and semantic web research. In this workshop, two recently awarded H2020 projects, Odeuropa and Polifonia, are teaming up to advance our understanding of how smells and music are represented in texts and structured data. The topics we want to address revolve around extracting references to smells, music, context, and visual information from text as well as relevant data describing their cultural, historical and political context, and model them in the form of interlinked knowledge graphs. This research has a strong  interdisciplinary character, hence the workshop has the potential to attract researchers from diverse disciplines from both social sciences and humanities and computer science. Its potential impact is significant to many application areas including: preservation and valorisation of cultural heritage, data-driven policy making in cultural heritage, urban planning, artistic performances, applications for scholars in musicology and history, applications for museums, innovation in teaching, maintenance and exploitation of large catalogues, archives and libraries. We aim at creating a reference venue where new ideas and results can be shared and lead the way towards a technological and cultural shift in how we understand and experience our cultural heritage.

# Topics 

We solicit submissions of long and short papers covering a wide range of NLP and semantic web topics dealing with the extraction and analysis of information from multisensory data. Papers presenting collaborations among researchers with different backgrounds or from different research communities are particularly welcome. Long papers should be between 10 and 15 pages, while short papers should include 6 to 8 pages and present a more focused contribution or a position paper. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

* Olfactory, musical and visual information extraction from text 
* Olfactory, musical and visual knowledge representation
* Resources for olfactory, musical and visual knowledge 
* Extraction of socio-cultural and historical context information from text
* Extraction of time, space, events, people and (musical, olfactory and visual) artifacts from text
* Knowledge graphs integrating  olfactory, musical and visual knowledge
* Multilingual text corpora on musical and olfactory heritage
* Automatic and semi-automatic generation of language descriptions of sensory experience 
* Methods and approaches to represent degrees of sensorial experiences (e.g. intensity, dissipation) 
* Applications for teaching/training/valorisation of multisensory data and knowledge 

Papers will be single-blind and will have to follow OASIcs template:
