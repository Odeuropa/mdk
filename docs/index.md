# Workshop description 

Our senses are the gateways to our memories and emotions. However, they are under-represented in language technology and semantic web research. In this workshop, two recently awarded H2020 projects, [Odeuropa](https://odeuropa.eu/) and [Polifonia](https://polifonia-project.eu/), are teaming up to advance our understanding of how smells and music are represented in texts and structured data. The topics we want to address revolve around extracting references to smells, music, context, and visual information from text as well as relevant data describing their cultural, historical and political context, and model them in the form of interlinked knowledge graphs. This research has a strong  interdisciplinary character, hence the workshop has the potential to attract researchers from diverse disciplines from both social sciences and humanities and computer science. Its potential impact is significant to many application areas including: preservation and valorisation of cultural heritage, data-driven policy making in cultural heritage, urban planning, artistic performances, applications for scholars in musicology and history, applications for museums, innovation in teaching, maintenance and exploitation of large catalogues, archives and libraries. We aim at creating a reference venue where new ideas and results can be shared and lead the way towards a technological and cultural shift in how we understand and experience our cultural heritage.
