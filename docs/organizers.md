### Enrico Daga
#### The Open University – UK
[mail](mailto:enrico.daga@open.ac.uk) - [website](http://www.enridaga.net/)

<p class="textblock" markdown="1">

Research Fellow at the Knowledge Media Institute of The Open University in the UK. After playing key roles in projects developing intelligent systems for Ontology Engineering (NeOn) and Smart Cities (MK:Smart), his recent research is exploring Knowledge Graphs applications focusing on policies and process knowledge, and the application of computational, knowledge-based methods in the humanities ([SPICE](http://spice-h2020.eu/)). He holds a PhD in computer science from the Open University and he is director of the [OU Open Knowledge Graph](http://data.open.ac.uk/). Currently, he is investigating hybrid methods combining Machine Learning and Knowledge Graphs in tasks such as domain-centric information retrieval (LED) and knowledge extraction (the [EU H2020 project Polifonia](http://www.polifonia-project.eu/)). Enrico is founder and co-chair of the [WHiSe Workshop on Humanities in the Semantic Web](http://whise.cc/2020/).

[mail](mailto:albert.merono@kcl.ac.uk) - [website](https://www.albertmeronyo.org/)

<p class="textblock" markdown="1">

Lecturer in Computer Science at King’s College London,  and works on Knowledge Graph construction, access, and use in digital humanities workflows, where he has built large (>10 billion triples) Knowledge Graphs for history and musicology. Previously he has been a  postdoctoral researcher at the Knowledge Representation & Reasoning group of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;  the lead engineer for structured data in [CLARIAH](https://clariah.nl/), a 32M EUR Dutch project for integrating Digital Humanities data; and has served  in CLARIAH’s Technical Board as coordinator of the LOD Interest Group. His automated Linked Data API construction methods [http://grlc.io](http://grlc.io) are today used in Elsevier, TNO, the eScience Center, and 3200 other users.

### Valentina Presutti
#### University of Bologna – Italy
[mail](mailto:valentina.presutti@unibo.it) - [website](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/valentina.presutti/en)

<p class="textblock" markdown="1">

Knowledge engineering expert, she leads the [Semantic Technology Laboratory](http://stlab.istc.cnr.it/), an interdisciplinary research group that involves researchers from the Italian National Research Council and the University of Bologna.  She holds a PhD in Computer Science (University of Bologna). Her research focuses on developing artificial intelligence methods for knowledge graph modeling and extraction, with focus on their application in discovery science (at the moment mainly in the Cultural Heritage domain). She is co-director of the [International Semantic Web Research Summer School (ISWS)](http://www.semanticwebschool.org/) and has served in organisational and scientific roles for several Semantic Web and Artificial Intelligence-related conferences. She is coordinating the scientific effort behind the [ArCo project](http://stlab.istc.cnr.it/stlab/project/arco/) and she is the coordinator of  the [H2020 Polifonia project](http://www.polifonia-project.eu/).

### Sara Tonelli
#### Fondazione Bruno Kessler – Italy
[mail](mailto:satonelli@fbk.eu) - [website](https://dh.fbk.eu/author/sara/)

<p class="textblock" markdown="1">

Head of the Digital Humanities research group at Fondazione Bruno Kessler. She holds a Master’s degree in Computational Linguistics  from Centrum für informations- und sprachverarbeitung in Munich and a Phd in Language Sciences from Università Ca’ Foscari in Venice. Her research interests focus on the analysis of non-standard language, including social media texts and historical corpora, as well as on multilingual language processing. She is particularly interested in zero- and few-shot learning, aimed at extracting information from large training data in a language and transferring this knowledge to resource-poor languages with minimal supervision. She is currently involved in the [Perceptions](https://project.perceptions.eu/) and in the [Odeuropa](https://odeuropa.eu/) projects, where she leads the work package on text analysis.

### Raphael Troncy
#### EURECOM - France
[mail](mailto:raphael.troncy@eurecom.fr) - [website](http://www.eurecom.fr/~troncy/)

<p class="textblock" markdown="1">

Associate Professor at the Data Science Department of EURECOM, France since 2009, leading the Data 2 Knowledge team. He obtained with honors a PhD from the University of Grenoble Alpes (France) together with the National Audio-Visual Institute (INA) in Paris and Inria Rhône Alpes in 2004. He was awarded ERCIM Post-Doctorate Research Associate in the National Research Council (CNR) in Pisa (Italy) in 2005, and in the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in Amsterdam (Netherlands) in 2006. His main research interest concerns the use of semantic web technologies for data integration and semantic multimedia annotations, information extraction and recommender systems. He has (co)organised more than 20 workshops in topics relevant to MDK 2021 usually held at ISWC, ESWC and TheWebConf.
