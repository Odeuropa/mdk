We solicit submissions of long and short papers covering a wide range of NLP and semantic web topics dealing with the extraction and analysis of information from multisensory data. Papers presenting collaborations among researchers with different backgrounds or from different research communities are particularly welcome. All submissions must be in PDF and written in English, single-blind and formatted in the style of the [ACM template and format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) as the main [TheWebConf 2023 conference](https://www2023.thewebconf.org/) (see the [instruction for authors](https://www2023.thewebconf.org/calls/research-tracks/)). Workshop papers should not exceed 12 pages in length (maximum 8 pages for the main paper content + maximum 2 pages for appendixes + maximum 2 pages for references). Papers must be submitted in PDF format according to the ACM template published in the ACM guidelines, selecting the generic “sigconf” sample. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded.
